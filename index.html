<h2>Famosteroids!</h2>
<p>This is the info page for the source repositiory for famosteroids. If you're looking for the live demo, it's <a href="http://seanmepi.github.io/famosteroids-dist/">here.</a> The source code is on the master branch.</p>

<p>So, after experimenting with writing a game-like thing in pure javscript <a href="https://github.com/SeanMEpi/soundbox">(here)</a> and then rewriting to take advantage of the famo.us physics engine, I decided to write a game from the ground up.  What better way to learn the physics engine in detail?  More or less arbitrairly I chose Asteroids, as I had already used some vector math in the previous projects and knew that I could use it again for the ship motion.  How hard could it be?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>To start off with, the documentation is rather thin.  There are a number of helpful tutorials at the famo.us university, but they are focused on web page UI.  The physics engine isn't really explained.  In the beginning it was off to stack overflow to find exanples of code for bouncing balls and such.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24513003/famo-us-balls-bouncing-each-other"This</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23399011/how-to-add-walls-to-a-famo-us-physics-simulation">this</a> got me a bounding box and stuff moving around inside of it.</p>
