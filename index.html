<h2>Famosteroids!</h2>
<p>This is the info page for the source repositiory for famosteroids. If you're looking for the live demo, it's <a href="http://seanmepi.github.io/famosteroids-dist/">here.</a> The source code is on the master branch.</p>

<p>So, after experimenting with writing a game-like thing in pure javscript <a href="https://github.com/SeanMEpi/soundbox">(here)</a> and then rewriting to take advantage of the famo.us physics engine, I decided to write a game from the ground up.  What better way to learn the physics engine in detail?  More or less arbitrairly I chose Asteroids, as I had already used some vector math in the previous projects and knew that I could use it again for the ship motion.  How hard could it be?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
