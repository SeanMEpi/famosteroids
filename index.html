<h2>Famosteroids!</h2>
<p>This is the info page for the source repositiory for famosteroids. If you're looking for the live demo, it's <a href="http://seanmepi.github.io/famosteroids-dist/">here.</a> The source code is on the famesteroids master branch.</p>
<p>This page here is intended to (eventually) be a jumping-off point for a tutorial.  At the moment I'm just recollecting the process and adding whatever silliness comes to mind.</p>
<p>(I should also add, that there will be no attempt here to wow you with ultramodern web design.  Just be happy I'm not using the blink tag).</p>

<p>So, after experimenting with writing a game-like thing in pure javscript <a href="https://github.com/SeanMEpi/soundbox">(here)</a> and then rewriting to take advantage of the famo.us physics engine, I decided to write a game from the ground up.  What better way to learn the physics engine in detail?  More or less arbitrairly I chose Asteroids, as I had already used some vector math in the previous projects and knew that I could use it again for the ship motion.  How hard could it be?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>To start off with, the documentation is rather thin.  There are a number of helpful tutorials at the famo.us university, but they are focused on web page UI.  The physics engine isn't really explained.  In the beginning it was off to stack overflow to find exanples of code for bouncing balls and such.  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24513003/famo-us-balls-bouncing-each-other">This</a> and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23399011/how-to-add-walls-to-a-famo-us-physics-simulation">this</a> got me a bounding box and stuff moving around inside of it.</p>
<p>Then I needed to keep the balls moving at a constant speed.  I was already imaging a game in space, and as most educated people are aware, no one can hear you scream there.  It's a vacuum.  This also means that objects in motion tend to remain in motion.  But the balls always slowed down.  So I asked Stack Overflow how to solve this problem.</p>

<p>In a relatively short period of time, a detailed answer was posted...that didn't solve my problem. [sigh].  So I wrote a solution myself.  To understand what I did, I'll have to explain a bit about how famo.us particles work.</p>
<p>Particles are a thing that the physics engine tracks.  Assign a particle to something, and the physics engine will keep track of its interactions with other things.  The particles can also be manipulated directly; i.e. with setPosition the particle can be placed where you want it.  So, to regulate the speed, I just find out what the speed and direction of the particle is, change the speed in whatever way I see fit, and keep the direction the same.  However, famous doesn't let you set the speed and direction of a particle directly; it lets you set the X and Y velocities.  So I dusted off the trig textbook (not really, I googled it) and wrote functions to convert X/Y velocities to speed and direction (a.k.a. polar coordinates) and back again.</p>
